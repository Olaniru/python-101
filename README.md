## python-101
A one-stop repository to document my python learning journey

In this repository, I will document my python learning experience. I should have started writing it since my first python print ("Hello World") task, but it's better late than never. 

# aim
This repo should serve three purposes:
1. to consolidate my learning. 
2. to serve as a cheat sheet for my future self
3. to hopefully help someone on their learning journey
